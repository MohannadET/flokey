# Flokey CLI

## Introduction:
Ever wandered if there's a k8s-like-manager for normal microservices (Yes all kind of microservices). Flokey is a tool that can manage a whole environment of microservices as dynamically as possible, a tool that can categorize a bunch of services under a specific type and send their machines a remote command, get logs, even manipulate .env file and other many other usages (you can find all the details in usage section).
